# 🧠 Unsupervised Learning: Clustering & Anomaly Detection (Week 3)

This repository contains a complete and well-documented implementation of Week 3 tasks for a machine learning course/project, focused on Unsupervised Learning using Python and Google Colab.

## 📌 Overview

This notebook walks through the following key concepts in unsupervised learning:

1. ✅ *K-Means Clustering from Scratch*
2. ✅ *Hierarchical Clustering with Dendrogram*
3. ✅ *DBSCAN vs K-Means on Noisy Data*
4. ✅ *Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)*
5. ✅ *Anomaly Detection*
   - Isolation Forest
   - Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

Each task includes:
- Clean and error-free code
- Inline comments and explanations
- Visualizations using Matplotlib

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (sklearn)
- SciPy

## 🚀 How to Use

 Run in Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Open the notebook via this link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19SGbiXjMWK1xiLWMN07DMp6y3X50tCCE?usp=sharing
2. Upload the .ipynb file or clone the repo.
3. Run each cell step-by-step. No setup needed.
